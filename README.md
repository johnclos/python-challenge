# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

## PYBANK EXERCISE
# it first imports the needed libraries
# it then creates the needed integers, strings, dictionaries and lists
# Next, it creates the path to collect data from the Resources folder, opens it and reads it in
# After reading the first row as a header, it loops through the data to get:
  # The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" from month-to-month over the entire period
  # find the current row value and the difference and then store the current value as the previous value        
  # The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  # The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  # The total number of months included in the dataset
  # The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# It then prints the summary to the screen and creates the text file with the same summary


## PYPOLL EXERCISE

# it first imports the needed libraries.
# it then creates the needed integers, strings, dictionaries and lists.
# Next, it creates the path to collect data from the Resources folder, opens it and reads it in.
# After reading the first row as a header, it loops through the data to get:
  # A complete list of candidates who received votes
  # the number of candidates
  # The total number of votes each candidate won
  # every time it come across a new name not already in dictionary, it adds a new key for the candidates name
  # othewise, if they are in the dictionary, it increases their vote count by one  
# After that, it loops through the values and converts them to percent
# It then creates a list of the votes and a list of the candidates
# It next finds the maximum num of votes and the index for the winner based on the maximum number of votes
# Finally, it prints the summary to the screen and creates the text file with the same summary
